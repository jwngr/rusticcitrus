# Rustic Citrus

Make sense out of alphabet stew with this addictive word game[available on the Windows
Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/rustic-citrus/c7f73eae-9de1-48ef-a99d-6a61105d8349).


## How To Play

In [Rustic Citrus](https://rusticcitrus.com/), rush against the clock to make as many words out of
a jumble of letters as you can. You gain points for building smaller words, but if you find the
biggest word possible, you’ll advance to the next round and get a chance to build your score even
higher! Start off with 5-letter jumbles, and if you’re feeling daring make the jump to 6-letter
and even 7-letter games.

Take some time to stop and notice the smooth visual style, the intuitive gameplay and animations,
and the jazzy soundtrack – but not too much time, you only have two minutes!

Rustic Citrus features an enormous dictionary of over 27,000 words so every game will be fresh like
an orange. If you’re in the middle of a great run and you’re interrupted, don’t worry – you can
save any number of games and return to them at any point. If you're up for the challenge, there are
also 55 fresh achievements for you to earn. And if at last you just can’t get that one word, Rustic
Citrus saves all your local high scores so you’ll know when you’ve gone further than ever before.

Rustic Citrus’s two minute rounds make it perfect for playing a quick round when you have a spare
moment. Add some flavor to your alphabet soup with Rustic Citrus!
